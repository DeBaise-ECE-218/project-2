### Project Description
This project involves the development of an automatic headlight system designed for modern vehicles using a Nucleo board. Utilizing a combination of sensors and inputs, including a driver seat occupancy sensor, an ignition push button, a blue indicator LED, a headlight mode selector, and a light sensor, the system intelligently controls the vehicle's headlights and ignition. The headlight subsystem is designed to respond dynamically to the ambient light conditions and the driver's selection of headlight mode—ON, OFF, or AUTO. In AUTO mode, the system adjusts the headlights based on external light levels, turning them on or off after brief delays to adapt to changing conditions of daylight and dusk, while always reverting to the headlights' previous state under intermediate light levels.


### Testing

**Ignition Subsystem**
| Specification                                                                                                                             | Result | Comments                                                                                                                              |

| Start the engine (i.e., light the blue LED) while the driver’s seat is occupied and when the ignition button is pushed and then released. | Pass   | Reliably starts the engine and indicates it only when the driver has sat down and only when the user button is released               |
| Keep the engine running even if the driver should exit the vehicle.                                                                       | Pass   | Upon the driver leaving (I.e. the push button sensor is relieved), the engine continues to run                                        |
| When the engine is running, stop the engine when the ignition button is pushed and then released (per the project criteria)               | Pass   |  If the engine is currently running (as indicated by the blue LED) and the user presses and releases the button, the engine turns off |

| If the engine is running, and the user selects: ON, turn on both low beam lamps; OFF, turn off all lamps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Pass   | When the user selects on using the potentiometer, the LEDs turn on consistently. When the user selects off using the potentiometer, the LEDs turn off consistently. Potentiometer returns consistent data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| If the user selects the AUTO position:  When the light level is above a “daylight” level, switch headlights off after a delay of 2 seconds. When the light level is below a “dusk” level, switch headlights on after a delay of 1 second. When between these two levels, the headlights should hold their previous state. | Pass   | Headlights will hold their state if in between a threshold value (dusk vs daylight) or if during the delay period, the light level goes back to being in between the thresholds/back to being at the current state's level. When testing the DUSK level, a finger was held roughly 4-6 inches above the sensor. Consistently, headlights came on after 1 second of a consistent dusk reading When testing the DAYLIGHT level, a flashlight was held roughly 1-2 feet above the sensor. Headlights turned off after 2 seconds. |
| Turn off all headlights when the engine is off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Pass   | No lights will turn on if the engine is not running. If headlights are on while the engine turns off, the headlights will turn off as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
